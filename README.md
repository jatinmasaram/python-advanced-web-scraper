## 💡 Project Overview
This project is a **powerful and reliable web scraper** built with Python. It demonstrates **professional software engineering practices**, including modular design, robust error handling, and ethical scraping techniques.  

The scraper extracts a complete dataset of **quotes, authors, and tags** from the multi-page site *[Quotes to Scrape](https://quotes.toscrape.com/)*. Unlike a simple one-off script, this project is structured as a **maintainable and scalable codebase**, making it an excellent **portfolio-ready project**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **🧩 Modular Design**  
  Split into three single-responsibility modules (`main.py`, `scrape_logic.py`, `data_processor.py`) for clarity and scalability.  

- **📄 Automated Pagination**  
  Dynamically follows "Next" links to scrape *all available pages*.  

- **🤝 Responsible Scraping**  
  Implements randomized delays between requests to avoid stressing target servers.  

- **🛡 Robust Error Handling**  
  Handles network failures and missing elements gracefully using `try-except`.  

- **📊 Structured Data Output**  
  Cleans and formats scraped content, exporting it into a ready-to-use **CSV file**.
