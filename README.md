📚 Advanced Quotes Web Scraper
Project Overview
This project is an advanced, production-ready web scraper built in Python. It is designed to navigate a multi-page website, collect data efficiently and responsibly, and demonstrate a robust, modular code architecture. The scraper targets the popular quotes.toscrape.com website to gather a comprehensive dataset of quotes, authors, and their associated tags.

This project goes beyond a basic script by focusing on key software engineering principles such as modularity, error handling, and maintainability, making it a strong example of a professional development workflow.

🚀 Key Features
Modular Architecture: The codebase is split into three distinct, single-responsibility modules (main.py, scrape_logic.py, data_processor.py) for clarity and ease of maintenance.

Automatic Pagination: The scraper intelligently identifies and follows "Next" links to traverse all available pages, ensuring a complete data harvest.

Responsible Scraping: It implements a randomized delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the target server, demonstrating an understanding of ethical web scraping practices.

Robust Error Handling: The script includes try-except blocks to gracefully manage common network failures and potential issues with missing HTML elements, ensuring the program runs to completion.

Structured Data Export: All extracted data is cleaned, structured, and saved into a clean .csv file, ready for further analysis or data processing tasks.

⚙️ How It Works
The scraper operates in a sequential, orchestrated flow:

The main.py script initializes the process by calling the scrape_all_pages() function.

Inside scrape_all_pages(), a loop is initiated. For each page:

A randomized delay is executed to respect the server.

The scrape_logic.py module is called to fetch and parse the HTML content of the current page.

The scraped data (quotes, authors, tags) from that single page is returned.

The main script accumulates this data in a central list.

The loop continues until no "Next" page link is found.

Finally, the data_processor.py module is invoked to take the complete dataset and save it into a new .csv file.

This modular design ensures that each component can be easily tested, updated, or repurposed for other projects without affecting the core logic.

🛠️ Installation and Usage
To run this project, you will need Python 3.8 or newer installed on your system.

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

Install the dependencies:
The project relies on requests and beautifulsoup4. Install them using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:

python main.py

After the script completes, a new file named all_quotes_modular.csv will be created in the project's root directory, containing the full dataset.
